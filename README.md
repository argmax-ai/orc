# Open Robot Communication Framework

The Open Robot Communication (ORC) Framework is a middleware library written in C++, with APIs in Python and C++. ORC is built on top of zeroMQ and it is designed for low-latency message exchange. It was developed at the Volkswagen Machine Learning Research Lab. ORC is currently running through an internal process determining the licensing format prior to release.

If you are interested in further details and performance comparisons to ROS, have a look at our paper published at the IEEE Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC) 2019:

The paper should be available online shortly.
